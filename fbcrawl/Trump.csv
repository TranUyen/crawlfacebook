Reddit,,"3,January,2016,at,11:50","<3 These Redditors. ""About a week ago, my wife found this squirrel at the side of the road twitching. He likely got hit by a car, and suffered major head trauma. She took him home. He couldn't eat, drink, walk, or really do anything. We were eventually able to get him to drink via a syringe. We reached out to a wildlife rehabilitater, who gave us some medicine to give him to help with the head trauma. Now, after 6 days on the medicine, He's doing a lot better. He's able to hold food on his own. He still needs help drinking. He can walk, but not very well. He often keeps his head to the side. We are still caring for him, though he will likely never be able to be released again. He may not be able to live a wild life, but if he continues to recover, we can help him live a good life.""
